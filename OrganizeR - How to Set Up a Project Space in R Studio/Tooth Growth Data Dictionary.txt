Description:
Vitamin C was given to guine pigs to see how the delivery method and dose influenced tooth growth. 

Hypothesis 1: a higher dose will have a more positive influence on tooth growth
Hypothesis 2: asorbic acid as a delivery method will have a more positive influence on tooth growth (asorbic acid is a type of vitamin C)


3 Variables: supplement deleviry method, tooth length, and supplement dose

Supplement delivery method (supp)
Level 1- asorbic acid (VC)
Level 2- orange juice (OJ)
variable type: ??

Supplement Dose (dose)
Level 1- ??
Level 2- ??
Level 3- ??
variable type: ??

Tooth length (len)
Variable measured in response to supp and dose
variable type: ??

the data set contains ?? subjects (guinea pigs)
